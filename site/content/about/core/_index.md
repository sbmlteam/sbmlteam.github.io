This page lists individuals and groups who have (or have had) specific roles, but this short list is not meant to diminish the contributions of the broader community of people and companies developing software systems that use SBML. People's involvements also change over time, and we try to keep this page updated to stay current with the SBML community.

## SBML Editors

The SBML Editors are devoted experts who develop specifications, correct errata, assess proposals, and manage revisions to SBML. The five Editors are elected by the SBML community and serve for three-year terms as volunteers.  One of the Editors is nominated by the other Editors to be Coordinator and lead activities such as organizing and chairing Editor meetings, monitoring progress on new SBML developments, and managing community votes.

## SBML Team

The SBML Team has been funded to support the SBML community and the development and maintenance of specific SBML infrastructure and facilities. In particular, the team was responsible for (1) maintaining this website, the SBML mailing lists, electronic surveys, and other resources; (2) arranging for the development and support of critical software, including [libSBML](Software/libSBML), the [SBML Validator](Facilities/Validator), and the SBML Test Suite; and (3) organizing [SBML events](Events).

Unfortunately there is no longer any formal funding but the following people contribute their time to maintaining the infrastructure they worked so long to develop.

  - **Nicolas Rodriguez** is a scientific programmer at the [Babraham Institute](http://www.babraham.ac.uk), where he is working in the [Bioinformatics group](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/).  He is the main developer of [SBMLeditor](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/compneur-srv/SBMLeditor.html) and the [Biomodels DB converters](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/compneur-srv/sbml/converters/). He is currently co-developing [JSBML](http://sbml.org/Software/JSBML).

  - [**Brett G. Olivier**](https://research.vu.nl/en/persons/bg-olivier) is a Biochemist who has specialised in research data managmement, computational systems biology and open-source, research software development.  Currently, he has positions at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam as a Research Data Steward for the AIMMS Insitutue and Faculty of Science. He is part of of the SBML team and has previously been both an SBML and a SED-ML editor.

Many people other have been members of the SBML Team in past years. In fact, there have been so many that we have devoted a whole [separate page](/about/core/past-sbml-team) to them!
