<div class="textblock"> An assignment to a variable by an SBML <em>event</em>. </p>
<p><a class="el" href="class_event__t.html" title=" A discontinuous SBML event. ">Event_t</a> contains an optional element called "listOfEventAssignments", of class <a class="el" href="class_list_of_event_assignments__t.html" title=" A list of EventAssignment_t objects. ">ListOfEventAssignments_t</a>. In every instance of an event definition in a model, the object's "listOfEventAssignments" element must have a non-empty list of one or more "eventAssignment" elements of class <a class="el" href="class_event_assignment__t.html" title=" An assignment to a variable by an SBML event. ">EventAssignment_t</a>. The object class <a class="el" href="class_event_assignment__t.html" title=" An assignment to a variable by an SBML event. ">EventAssignment_t</a> has one required attribute, "variable", and a required element, "math". Being derived from <a class="el" href="class_s_base__t.html" title=" SBML&#39;s SBase class, base class of most SBML objects. ">SBase_t</a>, it also has all the usual attributes and elements of its parent class.</p>
<p>An <a class="el" href="class_event__t.html" title=" A discontinuous SBML event. ">Event_t</a> object defines when the event can occur, the variables that are affected by the event, and how the variables are affected. The purpose of the <a class="el" href="class_event_assignment__t.html" title=" An assignment to a variable by an SBML event. ">EventAssignment_t</a> object class is to define how variables are affected by an <a class="el" href="class_event__t.html" title=" A discontinuous SBML event. ">Event_t</a>. In SBML Level&#160;2, every <a class="el" href="class_event__t.html" title=" A discontinuous SBML event. ">Event_t</a> object instance must have a nonempty list of event assignments; in SBML Level&#160;3, the list of assignments is optional.</p>
<p>The operation of an <a class="el" href="class_event__t.html" title=" A discontinuous SBML event. ">Event_t</a> is divided into two phases (regardless of whether a delay is involved): one phase when the event is <em>triggered</em>, and the other when the event is <em>executed</em>. <a class="el" href="class_event_assignment__t.html" title=" An assignment to a variable by an SBML event. ">EventAssignment_t</a> objects are interpreted when an event is executed. The effects are described below.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="event-variable"></a>
The attribute "variable"</h1>
<p>The <a class="el" href="class_event_assignment__t.html" title=" An assignment to a variable by an SBML event. ">EventAssignment_t</a> attribute "variable" must be the identifier of an existing <a class="el" href="class_compartment__t.html" title=" An SBML compartment, where species are located. ">Compartment_t</a>, <a class="el" href="class_species__t.html" title=" An SBML species – a pool of entities. ">Species_t</a>, <a class="el" href="class_species_reference__t.html" title=" A reference to an SBML species in a reaction. ">SpeciesReference_t</a>, or <a class="el" href="class_parameter__t.html" title=" An SBML parameter: a named symbol with a value. ">Parameter_t</a> instance defined in the model. In SBML Level&#160;3 Version&#160;2, this list was expanded to include identifiers of SBML Level&#160;3 package variables that have both mathematical meaning and the ability to be assigned. When the event is executed, the value of the model component identified by "variable" is changed by the <a class="el" href="class_event_assignment__t.html" title=" An assignment to a variable by an SBML event. ">EventAssignment_t</a> to the value computed by the "math" element; that is, a species' quantity, species reference's stoichiometry, compartment's size or parameter's value are reset to the value computed by "math".</p>
<p>Certain restrictions are placed on what can appear in "variable": </p><ul>
<li>
<p class="startli">The object identified by the value of the <a class="el" href="class_event_assignment__t.html" title=" An assignment to a variable by an SBML event. ">EventAssignment_t</a> attribute "variable" must not have its "constant" attribute set to or default to <code>true</code>. (Constants cannot be affected by events.)</p>
<p class="endli"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="startli">The "variable" attribute must not contain the identifier of a reaction. In SBML Level&#160;2 and SBML Level&#160;3 Version&#160;1, only species, species references, compartment and parameter values may be set by an <a class="el" href="class_event__t.html" title=" A discontinuous SBML event. ">Event_t</a>. In SBML Level&#160;3 Version&#160;2, the "variable" attribute may also be the identifier of an SBML Level&#160;3 package element with mathematical meaning and the ability to be assigned a value. This situation may only arise if the SBML package is present in the SBML document with a package:required attribute of <code>true</code> </p>
<p class="endli"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="startli">The value of every "variable" attribute must be unique among the set of <a class="el" href="class_event_assignment__t.html" title=" An assignment to a variable by an SBML event. ">EventAssignment_t</a> structures within a given <a class="el" href="class_event__t.html" title=" A discontinuous SBML event. ">Event_t</a> structure. In other words, a single event cannot have multiple <a class="el" href="class_event_assignment__t.html" title=" An assignment to a variable by an SBML event. ">EventAssignment_t</a> objects assigning the same variable. (All of them would be performed at the same time when that particular <a class="el" href="class_event__t.html" title=" A discontinuous SBML event. ">Event_t</a> triggers, resulting in indeterminacy.) However, <em>separate</em> <a class="el" href="class_event__t.html" title=" A discontinuous SBML event. ">Event_t</a> instances can refer to the same variable.</p>
<p class="endli"></p>
</li>
<li>
A variable cannot be assigned a value in an <a class="el" href="class_event_assignment__t.html" title=" An assignment to a variable by an SBML event. ">EventAssignment_t</a> object instance and also be assigned a value by an <a class="el" href="class_assignment_rule__t.html" title=" An SBML assignment rule representing x = f(Y). ">AssignmentRule_t</a>; i.e., the value of an <a class="el" href="class_event_assignment__t.html" title=" An assignment to a variable by an SBML event. ">EventAssignment_t</a>'s "variable" attribute cannot be the same as the value of a <a class="el" href="class_assignment_rule__t.html" title=" An SBML assignment rule representing x = f(Y). ">AssignmentRule_t</a>' "variable" attribute. (Assignment rules hold at all times, therefore it would be inconsistent to also define an event that reassigns the value of the same variable.) </li>
</ul>
<p>If the variable attribute of an <a class="el" href="class_event_assignment__t.html" title=" An assignment to a variable by an SBML event. ">EventAssignment_t</a> object references an object in an SBML namespace that is not understood by the interpreter reading a given SBML document (that is, if the object is defined by an SBML Level&#160;3 package that the software does not support), the event assignment must be ignored&ndash;the object's value will not need to be set, as the interpreter could not understand that package. If an interpreter cannot establish whether a referenced object is missing from the model or instead is defined in an SBML namespace not understood by the interpreter, it may produce a warning to the user. (The latter situation may only arise if an SBML package is present in the SBML document with a package:required attribute of "true".)</p>
<p>Note that the time of assignment of the object identified by the value of the "variable" attribute is always the time at which the <a class="el" href="class_event__t.html" title=" A discontinuous SBML event. ">Event_t</a> is <em>executed</em>, not when it is <em>triggered</em>. The timing is controlled by the optional <a class="el" href="class_delay__t.html" title=" A delay on the time of execution of an SBML event. ">Delay_t</a> in an <a class="el" href="class_event__t.html" title=" A discontinuous SBML event. ">Event_t</a>. The time of assignment is not affected by the "useValuesFromTriggerTime" attribute on <a class="el" href="class_event__t.html" title=" A discontinuous SBML event. ">Event_t</a>&mdash;that attribute affects the time at which the <a class="el" href="class_event_assignment__t.html" title=" An assignment to a variable by an SBML event. ">EventAssignment_t</a>'s "math" expression is <em>evaluated</em>. In other words, SBML allows decoupling the time at which the "variable" is assigned from the time at which its value expression is calculated.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="event-math"></a>
The "math" subelement in an EventAssignment_t</h1>
<p>The MathML expression contained in an <a class="el" href="class_event_assignment__t.html" title=" An assignment to a variable by an SBML event. ">EventAssignment_t</a> defines the new value of the variable being assigned by the <a class="el" href="class_event__t.html" title=" A discontinuous SBML event. ">Event_t</a>.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the time at which the expression in "math" is evaluated is determined by the attribute "useValuesFromTriggerTime" on <a class="el" href="class_event__t.html" title=" A discontinuous SBML event. ">Event_t</a>. If the attribute value is <code>true</code>, the expression must be evaluated when the event is <em>triggered</em>; more precisely, the values of identifiers occurring in MathML <code>&lt;ci&gt;</code> elements in the <a class="el" href="class_event_assignment__t.html" title=" An assignment to a variable by an SBML event. ">EventAssignment_t</a>'s "math" expression are the values they have at the point when the event <em>triggered</em>. If, instead, "useValuesFromTriggerTime"'s value is <code>false</code>, it means the values at <em>execution</em> time should be used; that is, the values of identifiers occurring in MathML <code>&lt;ci&gt;</code> elements in the <a class="el" href="class_event_assignment__t.html" title=" An assignment to a variable by an SBML event. ">EventAssignment_t</a>'s "math" expression are the values they have at the point when the event <em>executed</em>.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="eventassignment-version-diffs"></a>
SBML Level/Version differences</h1>
<p>Between Version&#160;4 and previous versions of SBML Level&#160;2, the requirements regarding the matching of units between an EvengAssignment's formula and the units of the object identified by the "variable" attribute changed. Previous versions required consistency, but in SBML Level&#160;2 Version&#160;4 and in SBML Level&#160;3, unit consistency is only <em>recommended</em>. More precisely: </p><ul>
<li>
<p class="startli">In the case of a species, an <a class="el" href="class_event_assignment__t.html" title=" An assignment to a variable by an SBML event. ">EventAssignment_t</a> sets the referenced species' quantity (concentration or amount of substance) to the value determined by the formula in the <a class="el" href="class_event_assignment__t.html" title=" An assignment to a variable by an SBML event. ">EventAssignment_t</a>'s "math" subelement. The units of the "math" formula should (in SBML Level&#160;2 Version&#160;4 and in Level&#160;3) or must (in previous Versions of Level&#160;2) be identical to the units of the species.</p>
<p class="endli"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="startli">(SBML Level&#160;3 only.) In the case of a species reference, an <a class="el" href="class_event_assignment__t.html" title=" An assignment to a variable by an SBML event. ">EventAssignment_t</a> sets the stoichiometry of the reactant or product referenced by the <a class="el" href="class_species_reference__t.html" title=" A reference to an SBML species in a reaction. ">SpeciesReference_t</a> object to the value determined by the formula in the "math" element. The unit associated with the value produced by the "math" formula should be <code>dimensionless</code>, because reactant and product stoichiometries in reactions are dimensionless quantities.</p>
<p class="endli"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="startli">In the case of a compartment, an <a class="el" href="class_event_assignment__t.html" title=" An assignment to a variable by an SBML event. ">EventAssignment_t</a> sets the referenced compartment's size to the size determined by the formula in the "math" subelement of the <a class="el" href="class_event_assignment__t.html" title=" An assignment to a variable by an SBML event. ">EventAssignment_t</a>. The overall units of the formula should (in SBML Level&#160;2 Version&#160;4 and in Level&#160;3) or must (in previous Versions of Level&#160;2) be identical to the units specified for the size of the compartment identified by the <a class="el" href="class_event_assignment__t.html" title=" An assignment to a variable by an SBML event. ">EventAssignment_t</a>'s "variable" attribute.</p>
<p class="endli"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="startli">In the case of a parameter, an <a class="el" href="class_event_assignment__t.html" title=" An assignment to a variable by an SBML event. ">EventAssignment_t</a> sets the referenced parameter's value to that determined by the formula in "math". The overall units of the formula should (in SBML Level&#160;2 Version&#160;4 and Level&#160;3) or must (in previous Versions of Level&#160;2) be identical to the units defined for the parameter.</p>
<p class="endli"></p>
</li>
<li>
(For SBML Level&#160;3 Version&#160;2 only) <em>In the case of an object from an SBML Level&#160;3 package</em>, an <a class="el" href="class_event_assignment__t.html" title=" An assignment to a variable by an SBML event. ">EventAssignment_t</a> sets the referenced object's value (as defined by that package) to the value of the formula in "math". The unit of measurement associated with the value produced by the formula should be the same as that object's units attribute value (if it has such an attribute), or be equal to the units of model components of that type (if objects of that class are defined by the package as having the same units). </li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the formula placed in the "math" element <em>has no assumed units</em>. The consistency of the units of the formula, and the units of the entity which the assignment affects, must be explicitly established just as in the case of the value of the <a class="el" href="class_delay__t.html" title=" A delay on the time of execution of an SBML event. ">Delay_t</a> subelement. An approach similar to the one discussed in the context of <a class="el" href="class_delay__t.html" title=" A delay on the time of execution of an SBML event. ">Delay_t</a> may be used for the formula of an <a class="el" href="class_event_assignment__t.html" title=" An assignment to a variable by an SBML event. ">EventAssignment_t</a>.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="event-asnt-restrictions"></a>
Restrictions relaxed in SBML Level 3 Version 2</h1>
<p>In SBML Level&#160;3 Version&#160;2, the requirement that an <a class="el" href="class_event_assignment__t.html" title=" An assignment to a variable by an SBML event. ">EventAssignment_t</a> have a "math" subelement was relaxed, making it optional. In this case, the <a class="el" href="class_event_assignment__t.html" title=" An assignment to a variable by an SBML event. ">EventAssignment_t</a> remains undefined, and unless that information is provided in some other form (such as with an SBML Level&#160;3 package), the <a class="el" href="class_event__t.html" title=" A discontinuous SBML event. ">Event_t</a> behaves as if it had no <a class="el" href="class_event_assignment__t.html" title=" An assignment to a variable by an SBML event. ">EventAssignment_t</a>.</p>
