<div class="textblock"> An SBML compartment, where species are located. </p>
<p>A compartment in SBML represents a bounded space in which species are located. Compartments do not necessarily have to correspond to actual structures inside or outside of a biological cell.</p>
<p>It is important to note that although compartments are optional in the overall definition of <a class="el" href="class_model__t.html" title=" An SBML model. ">Model_t</a>, every species in an SBML model must be located in a compartment. This in turn means that if a model defines any species, the model must also define at least one compartment. The reason is simply that species represent physical things, and therefore must exist <em>somewhere</em>. Compartments represent the <em>somewhere</em>.</p>
<p><a class="el" href="class_compartment__t.html" title=" An SBML compartment, where species are located. ">Compartment_t</a> has one required attribute, "id", to give the compartment a unique identifier by which other parts of an SBML model definition can refer to it. A compartment can also have an optional "name" attribute of type <code>string</code>. Identifiers and names must be used according to the guidelines described in the SBML specifications.</p>
<p><a class="el" href="class_compartment__t.html" title=" An SBML compartment, where species are located. ">Compartment_t</a> also has an optional attribute "spatialDimensions" that is used to indicate the number of spatial dimensions possessed by the compartment. Most modeling scenarios involve compartments with integer values of "spatialDimensions" of <code>3</code> (i.e., a three-dimensional compartment, which is to say, a volume), or 2 (a two-dimensional compartment, a surface), or <code>1</code> (a one-dimensional compartment, a line). In SBML Level&#160;3, the type of this attribute is <code>double</code>, there are no restrictions on the permitted values of the "spatialDimensions" attribute, and there are no default values. In SBML Level&#160;2, the value must be a positive <code>integer</code>, and the default value is <code>3</code>; the permissible values in SBML Level&#160;2 are <code>3</code>, <code>2</code>, <code>1</code>, and <code>0</code> (for a point).</p>
<p>Another optional attribute on <a class="el" href="class_compartment__t.html" title=" An SBML compartment, where species are located. ">Compartment_t</a> is "size", representing the <em>initial</em> total size of that compartment in the model. The "size" attribute must be a floating-point value and may represent a volume (if the compartment is a three-dimensional one), or an area (if the compartment is two-dimensional), or a length (if the compartment is one-dimensional). There is no default value of compartment size in SBML Level&#160;2 or Level&#160;3. In particular, a missing "size" value <em>does not imply that the compartment size is 1</em>. (This is unlike the definition of compartment "volume" in SBML Level&#160;1.) When the compartment's "spatialDimensions" attribute does not have a value of <code>0</code>, a missing value of "size" for a given compartment signifies that the value either is unknown, or to be obtained from an external source, or determined by an <a class="el" href="class_initial_assignment__t.html" title=" An SBML initial assignment, evaluated once only. ">InitialAssignment_t</a>, <a class="el" href="class_assignment_rule__t.html" title=" An SBML assignment rule representing x = f(Y). ">AssignmentRule_t</a>, <a class="el" href="class_algebraic_rule__t.html" title=" An SBML algebraic rule representing 0 = f(W). ">AlgebraicRule_t</a> or <a class="el" href="class_rate_rule__t.html" title=" An SBML rate rule representing dx/dt = f(Y). ">RateRule_t</a> structure elsewhere in the model. In SBML Level&#160;2, there are additional special requirements on the values of "size"; we discuss them in a <a href="#comp-l2">separate section below</a>.</p>
<p>The units associated with a compartment's "size" attribute value may be set using the optional attribute "units". The rules for setting and using compartment size units differ between SBML Level&#160;2 and Level&#160;3, and are discussed separately below.</p>
<p>Finally, the <a class="el" href="class_compartment__t.html" title=" An SBML compartment, where species are located. ">Compartment_t</a> attribute named "constant" is used to indicate whether the compartment's size stays constant after simulation begins. A value of <code>true</code> indicates the compartment's "size" cannot be changed by any other construct except <a class="el" href="class_initial_assignment__t.html" title=" An SBML initial assignment, evaluated once only. ">InitialAssignment_t</a>; a value of <code>false</code> indicates the compartment's "size" can be changed by other constructs in SBML. In SBML Level&#160;2, there is an additional explicit restriction that if "spatialDimensions"=<code>"0"</code>, the value cannot be changed by <a class="el" href="class_initial_assignment__t.html" title=" An SBML initial assignment, evaluated once only. ">InitialAssignment_t</a> either. Further, in Level&#160;2, "constant" is optional, and has a default value of <code>true</code>. In SBML Level&#160;3, there is no default value for the "constant" attribute, and it is required.</p>

Additional considerations in SBML Level 2</h1>
<p>In SBML Level&#160;2, the default units of compartment size, and the kinds of units allowed as values of the attribute "units", interact with the number of spatial dimensions of the compartment. The value of the "units" attribute of a <a class="el" href="class_compartment__t.html" title=" An SBML compartment, where species are located. ">Compartment_t</a> structure must be one of the base units (see <a class="el" href="class_unit__t.html" title=" A single unit referenced in an SBML unit definition. ">Unit_t</a>), or the predefined unit identifiers <code>volume</code>, <code>area</code>, <code>length</code> or <code>dimensionless</code>, or a new unit defined by a <a class="el" href="class_unit_definition__t.html" title=" A definition of a unit used in an SBML model. ">UnitDefinition_t</a> structure in the enclosing <a class="el" href="class_model__t.html" title=" An SBML model. ">Model_t</a>, subject to the restrictions detailed in the following table:</p>

<p>In SBML Level&#160;2, the units of the compartment size, as defined by the "units" attribute or (if "units" is not set) the default value listed in the table above, are used in the following ways when the compartment has a "spatialDimensions" value greater than <code>0</code>: </p><ul>
<li>
<p class="startli">The value of the "units" attribute is used as the units of the compartment identifier when the identifier appears as a numerical quantity in a mathematical formula expressed in MathML.</p>
<p class="endli"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="startli">The <code>math</code> element of an <a class="el" href="class_assignment_rule__t.html" title=" An SBML assignment rule representing x = f(Y). ">AssignmentRule_t</a> or <a class="el" href="class_initial_assignment__t.html" title=" An SBML initial assignment, evaluated once only. ">InitialAssignment_t</a> referring to this compartment <em>must</em> (in Level&#160;2 Versions&#160;1-3) or <em>should</em> (in Level&#160;2 Version 4) have identical units.</p>
<p class="endli"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="startli">In <a class="el" href="class_rate_rule__t.html" title=" An SBML rate rule representing dx/dt = f(Y). ">RateRule_t</a> objects that set the rate of change of the compartment's size, the units of the rule's <code>math</code> element <em>must</em> (in Level&#160;2 Versions&#160;1&ndash;3) or <em>should</em> (in Level&#160;2 Version 4) be identical to the compartment's units (whether defined by the "units" attribute or by taking the default value from the <a class="el" href="class_model__t.html" title=" An SBML model. ">Model_t</a>) divided by the default <em>time</em> units. (In other words, the units for the rate of change of compartment size are <em>compartment size</em>/<em>time</em> units.</p>
<p class="endli"></p>
</li>
<li>
When a <a class="el" href="class_species__t.html" title=" An SBML species – a pool of entities. ">Species_t</a> is to be treated in terms of concentrations or density, the units of the spatial size portion of the concentration value (i.e., the denominator in the units formula <em>substance/<em>size</em>)</em> are those indicated by the value of the "units" attribute on the compartment in which the species is located. </li>
</ul>
<p>Compartments with "spatialDimensions"=<code>0</code> require special treatment in this framework. As implied above, the "size" attribute must not have a value on an SBML Level&#160;2 <a class="el" href="class_compartment__t.html" title=" An SBML compartment, where species are located. ">Compartment_t</a> structure if the "spatialDimensions" attribute has a value of <code>0</code>. An additional related restriction is that the "constant" attribute must default to or be set to <code>true</code> if the value of the "spatialDimensions" attribute is <code>0</code>, because a zero-dimensional compartment cannot ever have a size.</p>
<p>If a compartment has no size or dimensional units, how should such a compartment's identifier be interpreted when it appears in mathematical formulas? The answer is that such a compartment's identifier should not appear in mathematical formulas in the first place&mdash;it has no value, and its value cannot change. Note also that a zero-dimensional compartment is a point, and species located at points can only be described in terms of amounts, not spatially-dependent measures such as concentration. Since SBML <a class="el" href="class_kinetic_law__t.html" title=" The rate expression for an SBML reaction. ">KineticLaw_t</a> formulas are already in terms of <em>substance/<em>time</em> and</em> not (say) <em>concentration/<em>time</em>,</em> volume or other factors in principle are not needed for species located in zero-dimensional compartments.</p>
<p>Finally, in SBML Level&#160;2 Versions 2&ndash;4, each compartment in a model may optionally be designated as belonging to a particular compartment <em>type</em>. The optional attribute "compartmentType" is used identify the compartment type represented by the <a class="el" href="class_compartment__t.html" title=" An SBML compartment, where species are located. ">Compartment_t</a> structure. The "compartmentType" attribute's value must be the identifier of a <a class="el" href="class_compartment_type__t.html" title=" A compartment type in SBML Level&#160;2. ">CompartmentType_t</a> instance defined in the model. If the "compartmentType" attribute is not present on a particular compartment definition, a unique virtual compartment type is assumed for that compartment, and no other compartment can belong to that compartment type. The values of "compartmentType" attributes on compartments have no effect on the numerical interpretation of a model. Simulators and other numerical analysis software may ignore "compartmentType" attributes. The "compartmentType" attribute and the <a class="el" href="class_compartment_type__t.html" title=" A compartment type in SBML Level&#160;2. ">CompartmentType_t</a> structures are not present in SBML Level&#160;3 Core nor in SBML Level&#160;1.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="comp-l3"></a>
Additional considerations in SBML Level 3</h1>
<p>One difference between SBML Level&#160;3 and lower Levels of SBML is that there are no restrictions on the permissible values of the "spatialDimensions" attribute, and there is no default value defined for the attribute. The value of "spatialDimensions" does not have to be an integer, either; this is to allow for the possibility of representing structures with fractal dimensions.</p>
<p>The number of spatial dimensions possessed by a compartment cannot enter into mathematical formulas, and therefore cannot directly alter the numerical interpretation of a model. However, the value of "spatialDimensions" <em>does</em> affect the interpretation of the units associated with a compartment's size. Specifically, the value of "spatialDimensions" is used to select among the <a class="el" href="class_model__t.html" title=" An SBML model. ">Model_t</a> attributes "volumeUnits", "areaUnits" and "lengthUnits" when a <a class="el" href="class_compartment__t.html" title=" An SBML compartment, where species are located. ">Compartment_t</a> object does not define a value for its "units" attribute.</p>
<p>The "units" attribute may be left unspecified for a given compartment in a model; in that case, the compartment inherits the unit of measurement specified by one of the attributes on the enclosing <a class="el" href="class_model__t.html" title=" An SBML model. ">Model_t</a> structure instance. The applicable attribute on <a class="el" href="class_model__t.html" title=" An SBML model. ">Model_t</a> depends on the value of the compartment's "spatialDimensions" attribute; the relationship is shown in the table below. If the <a class="el" href="class_model__t.html" title=" An SBML model. ">Model_t</a> structure does not define the relevant attribute ("volumeUnits", "areaUnits" or "lengthUnits") for a given "spatialDimensions" value, the unit associated with that <a class="el" href="class_compartment__t.html" title=" An SBML compartment, where species are located. ">Compartment_t</a> structure's size is undefined. If a given <a class="el" href="class_compartment__t.html" title=" An SBML compartment, where species are located. ">Compartment_t</a>'s "units" are left unset and the "spatialDimensions" either has a value other than <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, or <code>3</code> or is left unset itself (as it has no default value), then no unit can be chosen from among the <a class="el" href="class_model__t.html" title=" An SBML model. ">Model_t</a>'s "volumeUnits", "areaUnits" or "lengthUnits" attributes (even if the <a class="el" href="class_model__t.html" title=" An SBML model. ">Model_t</a> instance provides values for those attributes), because there is no basis to select between them. Leaving the units of compartments' sizes undefined in an SBML model does not render the model invalid; however, as a matter of best practice, we strongly recommend that all models specify the units of measurement for all compartment sizes.</p>

Other aspects of Compartment_t</h1>
<p>In SBML Level&#160;1 and Level&#160;2, <a class="el" href="class_compartment__t.html" title=" An SBML compartment, where species are located. ">Compartment_t</a> has an optional attribute named "outside", whose value can be the identifier of another <a class="el" href="class_compartment__t.html" title=" An SBML compartment, where species are located. ">Compartment_t</a> structure defined in the enclosing <a class="el" href="class_model__t.html" title=" An SBML model. ">Model_t</a> structure. Doing so means that the other compartment contains it or is outside of it. This enables the representation of simple topological relationships between compartments, for those simulation systems that can make use of the information (e.g., for drawing simple diagrams of compartments). It is worth noting that in SBML, there is no relationship between compartment sizes when compartment positioning is expressed using the "outside" attribute. The size of a given compartment does not in any sense include the sizes of other compartments having it as the value of their "outside" attributes. In other words, if a compartment <em>B</em> has the identifier of compartment <em>A</em> as its "outside" attribute value, the size of <em>A</em> does not include the size of <em>B</em>. The compartment sizes are separate.</p>
<p>In Level&#160;2, there are two restrictions on the "outside" attribute. First, because a compartment with "spatialDimensions" of <code>0</code> has no size, such a compartment cannot act as the container of any other compartment <em>except</em> compartments that <em>also</em> have "spatialDimensions" values of <code>0</code>. Second, the directed graph formed by representing <a class="el" href="class_compartment__t.html" title=" An SBML compartment, where species are located. ">Compartment_t</a> structures as vertexes and the "outside" attribute values as edges must be acyclic. The latter condition is imposed to prevent a compartment from being contained inside itself. In the absence of a value for "outside", compartment definitions in SBML Level&#160;2 do not have any implied spatial relationships between each other. </p>

<dl class="section user"><dt></dt><dd>The identifier given by an object's "id" attribute value is used to identify the object within the SBML model definition. Other objects can refer to the component using this identifier. The data type of "id" is always <code>SId</code> or a type derived from that, such as <code>UnitSId</code>, depending on the object in question. All data types are defined as follows: <pre style="margin-left: 2em; border: none; font-weight: bold; color: black">

This applies to all uses of <code>SId</code>, <code>SIdRef</code>, and derived types.</dd></dl>
<p>Users need to be aware of some important API issues that are the result of the history of SBML and libSBML. Prior to SBML Level&#160;3 Version&#160;2, SBML defined "id" and "name" attributes on only a subset of SBML objects. To simplify the work of programmers, libSBML's API provided get, set, check, and unset on the <a class="el" href="class_s_base__t.html" title=" SBML&#39;s SBase class, base class of most SBML objects. ">SBase_t</a> object class itself instead of on individual subobject classes. This made the get/set/etc. methods uniformly available on all objects in the libSBML API. LibSBML simply returned empty strings or otherwise did not act when the methods were applied to SBML objects that were not defined by the SBML specification to have "id" or "name" attributes. Additional complications arose with the rule and assignment objects: <a class="el" href="class_initial_assignment__t.html" title=" An SBML initial assignment, evaluated once only. ">InitialAssignment_t</a>, <a class="el" href="class_event_assignment__t.html" title=" An assignment to a variable by an SBML event. ">EventAssignment_t</a>, <a class="el" href="class_assignment_rule__t.html" title=" An SBML assignment rule representing x = f(Y). ">AssignmentRule_t</a>, and <a class="el" href="class_rate_rule__t.html" title=" An SBML rate rule representing dx/dt = f(Y). ">RateRule_t</a>. In early versions of SBML, the rule object hierarchy was different, and in addition, then as now, they possess different attributes: "variable" (for the rules and event assignments), "symbol" (for initial assignments), or neither (for algebraic rules). Prior to SBML Level&#160;3 Version&#160;2, getId() would always return an empty string, and isSetId() would always return <code>false</code> for objects of these classes.</p>
<p>With the addition of "id" and "name" attributes on <a class="el" href="class_s_base__t.html" title=" SBML&#39;s SBase class, base class of most SBML objects. ">SBase_t</a> in Level&#160;3 Version&#160;2, it became necessary to introduce a new way to interact with the attributes more consistently in libSBML to avoid breaking backward compatibility in the behavior of the original "id" methods. For this reason, libSBML provides four functions (getIdAttribute(), setIdAttribute(), isSetIdAttribute(), and unsetIdAttribute()) that always act on the actual "id" attribute inherited from <a class="el" href="class_s_base__t.html" title=" SBML&#39;s SBase class, base class of most SBML objects. ">SBase_t</a>, regardless of the object's type. <b>These new methods should be used instead of the older getId()/setId()/etc. methods</b> unless the old behavior is somehow necessary. Regardless of the Level and Version of the SBML, these functions allow client applications to use more generalized code in some situations (for instance, when manipulating objects that are all known to have identifiers). If the object in question does not posess an "id" attribute according to the SBML specification for the Level and Version in use, libSBML will not allow the identifier to be set, nor will it read or write "id" attributes for those objects.</p>

<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>The attribute "volume" only exists by that name in SBML Level&#160;1. In Level&#160;2 and above, the equivalent attribute is named "size". In SBML Level&#160;1, a compartment's volume has a default value (<code>1.0</code>) and therefore methods such as <a class="el" href="class_compartment__t.html#a00194f8b94a6e60f53b34fd976e7c1fb" title="Predicate returning 1 (true) if the given Compartment_t structures&#39;s &quot;volume&quot; attribute is set...">Compartment_isSetVolume()</a> will always return <code>true</code> for a Level&#160;1 model. In Level&#160;2, a compartment's size (the equivalent of SBML Level&#160;1's "volume") is optional and has no default value, and therefore may or may not be set.</dd></dl>
