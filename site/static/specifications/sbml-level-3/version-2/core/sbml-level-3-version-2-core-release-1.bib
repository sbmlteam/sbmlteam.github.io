  abstract = {Computational models can help researchers to interpret data, understand
biological functions, and make quantitative predictions. The Systems
Biology Markup Language (SBML) is a file format for representing
computational models in a declarative form that different software systems
can exchange. SBML is oriented towards describing biological processes of
the sort common in research on a number of topics, including metabolic
pathways, cell signaling pathways, and many others. By supporting SBML as
an input/output format, different tools can all operate on an identical
representation of a model, removing opportunities for translation errors
and assuring a common starting point for analyses and simulations. This
document provides the specification for Version 2 of SBML Level 3 Core.
The specification defines the data structures prescribed by SBML, their
encoding in XML (the eXtensible Markup Language), validation rules that
determine the validity of an SBML document, and examples of models in SBML
form. The design of Version 2 differs from Version 1 principally in
allowing new MathML constructs, making more child elements optional, and
adding identifiers to all SBML elements instead of only selected elements.
Other materials and software are available from the SBML project website
at http://sbml.org/.},
